            Your GP (General Practitioner) will help you, if you think you or someone you know has breast cancer. 
            They should be the first person you go to, and will give you all the advice you need throughout treatment.
            <h3>Some Misconceptions You Should Know</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Only Females Can Get Alzheimer's - Wrong. Although it is very rare, males can also be afflicted by breast cancer.</li>
                <li>Breast Cancer is Mainly Hereditary - Wrong. Although about 10% of causes are hereditary, other factors such as lifestyle choices can cause it.</li>
                <li>Phones Can Cause Breast Cancer - Wrong. Phone radiation is completely harmless.</li>
                <li>If there is no lump, there is no cancer - Wrong. Especially in early stages (but also sometimes in later stages), there is no discernible lump near the breast.</li>
